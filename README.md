The Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation project aims to develop a simple, interactive, and user-friendly console-based version of the classic two-player game using C. Players alternate placing their markers (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, striving to form a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
